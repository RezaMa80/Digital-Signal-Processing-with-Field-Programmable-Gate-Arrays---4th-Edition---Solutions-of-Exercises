In Balanced and Area optimization the results are the same. This may be due to the use of memory blocks in both optimizations.
In other words, in the Balance optimization, the compiler decided to use memory blocks and this limits the clock speed.

In Speed optimization instead of using memory, registers were used, which increased the clock speed.
