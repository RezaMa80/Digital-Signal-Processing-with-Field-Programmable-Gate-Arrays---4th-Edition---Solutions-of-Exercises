Process P0:
a) Inputs: a, b, c, d - Outputs: u
Three adder in series, first adder for a+b, second one for subtracting c and last one for adding d
b) 3
c) a to u - 3

Process P1:
a) Inputs: a, b, c, d - Outputs: v
Three adder, two of them in parallel, first adder for a+b, second one for c-d and last one for subtracting a+b from c-d
b) 3
c) Every input to v - 2

Process P2:
a) Inputs: a, b, c - Outputs: w, x
Two adder in series for each output, for w, first adder for a+b and second one for adding c, for x, first adder for a-b and second one for subtracting c
b) 4
c) a and b to every output - 2

Process P3:
a) Inputs: a, b, c - Outputs: y, z
One common adder used in both outputs and one another adder for each output, first one for b+c, another one for y, for adding a, another one for z, for subtracting b+c from a
b) 3
c) b and c to every output - 2
