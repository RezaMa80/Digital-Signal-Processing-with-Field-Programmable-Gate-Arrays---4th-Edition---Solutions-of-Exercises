The number of logic elements are the same in all optimizations but in Speed optimization Fmax is higher, so the optimal option is Speed.
In both one instantiation and maximized instantiation designs only logic elements are used and no multipliers and memory blocks are used.
The number of logic elements and registers per instantiation in maximized design is lower.
By maximizing the number of instantiations Fmax decreased drastically.
