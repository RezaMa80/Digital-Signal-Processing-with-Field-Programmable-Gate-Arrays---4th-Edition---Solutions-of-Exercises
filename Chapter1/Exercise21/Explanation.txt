Process P0:
Circuit type: D-flip-flop
a is clock

combinational, latch, D-flip-flop, or T-flip-flop
clock, a-synchronous set (AS) or reset (AR) or synchronous set (SS) or reset
(SR)

Process P1:
Circuit type: Combinational
a is AS

Process P2:
Circuit type: D-flip-flop
a is AR
b is clock
c is SS

Process P3:
Circuit type: T-flip-flop
a is AS
b is clock
c is SR

Process P4:
Circuit type: Latch
a is AS

Process P5:
Circuit type: D-flip-flop
a is clock
b is SR
